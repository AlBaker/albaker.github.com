Recently I had the need to bundle an application to run on the command line.  Before, I had created a war file with embeddd Jetty, so that all the normal dependencies could just be internally dropped in WEB-INF/lib.  There's a new way to go about this type of application with [Spring Boot](http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/).

Whether you use the Spring framework, or even Spring Boot or not, the Spring Boot build file and package rewrite they do to support, effectively, jars-in-jars classloading is extremely usefl.

Here's all you need.  Your main class doesn't have to do anything special, you package a jar with the application plugin as normal, and that's that.
